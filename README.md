# Boosted apps
Hello everyone, I'm an experienced iOS developer (10 years). In this year I see a lot of apps in top-1/top-2 high-score keywords with small number of ratings and reviews. After checking these apps in tools I saw that they were definetely boosted by keywords.  In this repository I will be adding apps that have been boosted to the top keywords on the appstore. If you have examples of apps that have been boosted with proof, please send them to me.  Big request to make a post about this in twitter account or any other social networks. Maybe someone you know has examples of dishonest apps and we can cleanse our community of cheaters.
